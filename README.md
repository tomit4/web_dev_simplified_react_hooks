## Web Dev Simplified React Hooks

This code is a following along of [Web Dev Simplfied's YT Playlist series on React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h), specifically the use_effect hook.

To install modern react as of 2023, make a directory with the project name, cd into it, and install via [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/):

```
mkdir my_project_name && cd "$_" && npm create vite@latest .
```

Then choose 'React' from the cli options menu, and also the 'JS with SWC' option.

After that simply install the dependencies and run the dev server:

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

This will serve base application (usually from port 5173).
