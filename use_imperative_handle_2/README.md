## Web Dev Simplified React Hooks (useImperativeHandle)

This code is a following along of [Web Dev Simplfied's YT Playlist series on React Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h), specifically the useImperativeHandle hook.

## NOTE on useImperativeHandle Hook

Kyle's implementation here appears to be outdated and misinterprets the modern use of this specific hook. Probably not going to use for starter projects, but consult official documentation when attempting to use this.
